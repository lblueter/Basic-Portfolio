            Hello! My name is Logan Blueter, I am an aspiring web developer from Ohio. I graduated from Highland Highschool in 2013.
            I currently live with my parents and my two younger sisters. We have two dogs and two cats. My father was in
            the Army for six years working with network security and we have always been big into computers and technology.
            When I was younger my dad and I made a website for our family together thought he did most the work and I just
            picked out pictures and old flash games to embed in the page. That was my first experience with web design and
            I have been interested since then. Though I haven’t had much experience coding I have had much experience with
            computer software and hardware and know the basics. I have built my own computer and have setup my own network
            as well as doing the same for various friends and family. Much of what I know is thanks to my family and I owe
            a lot to them. I am currently looking forward to the new knowledge and experience I am going to gain at the Case
            Western Reserve University Coding Bootcamp. Someday I hope to make a great career out of the skills I am going
            to be learning over the next 6 months.
